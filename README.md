Autohotkey script by Jagar82 (Based on Oversampled's Ahk Script - https://oversampled.us/products/abletonahk - and Live Enhancement Suite - https://github.com/LiveEnhancementSuite/LESforWindows)  

STEPS
1. Download and install Autohotkey v2: https://www.autohotkey.com/
2. Download and install Powertoys: https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/releases/tag/v0.81. (Or any software that allows you to remap keys. Running it at startup is recommended).
3. Remap Right Shift and Right Alt to any key you wish . I did it with < (Spanish Layout).
4. Feel the power ᕙ(⇀‸↼‶)ᕗ  (Don't forget that you can modify all of this to your taste and even upload it; just remember to link this repo . MIT License B) ).


(Hope you enjoy :D)
