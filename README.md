Autohotkey script by Jagar82 (Inspired by Oversampled's Ahk Script - https://oversampled.us/products/abletonahk - and Live Enhancement Suite - https://github.com/LiveEnhancementSuite/LESforWindows)  

STEPS

1. Download and install Autohotkey v2: https://www.autohotkey.com/
2. Download and save these Scripts to your lib (C:\Users\Username\Documents\AutoHotkey\lib) as HideSystemCursor and FindText, correspondingly. Credits to Feiyue and Mikeyww. ; https://www.autohotkey.com/boards/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=17834 - https://www.autohotkey.com/boards/viewtopic.php?t=102022
3. Download and install Sharpkeys: https://github.com/randyrants/sharpkeys - https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/XPFFCG7M673D4F?ocid=pdpshare. Remap Right Shift and Right Alt to any key you wish. I did it with Caps Lock (RShift) and < (RAlt) (Spanish keyboard Layout). You may set Windows input method to English, but it's not a requirement.
4. Tagging (best option, easier) or making racks / presets (.adg, .adv) for your most used effects and instruments (VSTs included) is recommended, so Ableton avoids choosing the wrong effect. For tags, just group your devices with a single tag, search “Effect Picker” in this script, and modify the two lines just before %item%, so your tag is typed correctly (remove the ;). For the racks / devices method, make presets for each effect, naming them like “D. Compressor”, and customize the individual hotkeys so they type the new preset name.
5. Some hotkeys use a kind of imagesearch (Record with Double R, Find in selected folder, Open Plugin Window). Set Windows to 1920 x 1080 and 150% zoom for an optimal experience.
6. Feel the power ᕙ(⇀‸↼‶)ᕗ  (Don't forget that you can modify all of this to your taste and even upload it; just remember to link this repo and credit Oversampled and LES Scripts. MIT License B) ).
