INSTALLATION AND USE STEPS

1. Download and install Autohotkey v2: https://www.autohotkey.com/download/ahk-v2.exe
2. Download and install Sharpkeys: https://github.com/randyrants/sharpkeys/releases/download/v3.9.4/sharpkeys394.zip. Remap Right Control and Right Alt to any key you wish . I did it with Caps Lock (RCtrl) and < (RAlt).
3. Activate Tab Navigation (pretty much all of the shortcuts won't work or will go crazy if you don't) - Settings / Use Tab Key to Navigate & Wrap Tab Navigation / ON.
4. Set Live in English. This is required for some hotkeys to work correctly, specifically those which depend on the menu bar dropdowns. 
5. Feel the power ᕙ(⇀‸↼‶)ᕗ  (Don't forget that you can modify all of this to your taste and even upload it; just remember to link this repo and credits it. MIT License B) ).

NOTE: Quick Inserts can't sort out your favorite devices in the Ableton browser. To use it more accurately, activate the ''Rank'' filter in the browser so it sorts by your most used FX/Devices.
