Autohotkey script by Jagar82 (Based on Oversampled's Ahk Script - https://oversampled.us/products/abletonahk - and Live Enhancement Suite - https://github.com/LiveEnhancementSuite/LESforWindows)  

;STEPS

1. Download and install Autohotkey v2: https://www.autohotkey.com/
2. Download and save these Scripts to your lib (C:\Users\Username\Documents\AutoHotkey\lib) as HideSystemCursor and FindText, correspondingly. Credits to Feiyue and Mikeyww. https://www.autohotkey.com/boards/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=17834 - https://www.autohotkey.com/boards/viewtopic.php?t=102022
3. Download and install Powertoys: https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/releases/tag/v0.81. (Or any software that allows you to remap keys. Running it at startup is recommended).
4. Remap Right Shift and Right Alt to any key you wish . I did it with < (Spanish Layout).
5. Some hotkeys use a kind of imagesearch. Set Windows to 1920 x 1080 and 150% zoom for an optimal experience. 
6. Feel the power ᕙ(⇀‸↼‶)ᕗ  (Don't forget that you can modify all of this to your taste and even upload it; just remember to link this repo . MIT License B) ).

(Hope you enjoy :D)
